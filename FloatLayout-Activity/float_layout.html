    <p id="aboutmedesc">My name is Andrew Luttrell, and I currently attend Irvine Valley College. I am also currently attending the Programming bootcamp hosted by UCI in hopes of pursuing a career in web development as a back-end developer. I have always enjoyed chasing after what presents a challenge to me, which is why i find web development so interesting. There are always new situations being presented with so many ways to work around them.</p>
